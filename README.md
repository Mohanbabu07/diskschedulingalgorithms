## About the Project

Disk scheduling is a key component in operating system design, impacting the overall efficiency of disk operations. This simulation aims to educate and demonstrate how different disk scheduling algorithms manage and optimize disk I/O requests.

## Supported Algorithms

The simulation includes the following disk scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
- LOOK and C-LOOK Variants
